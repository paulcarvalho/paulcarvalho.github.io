### About me

I'm currently the programming lead for the R-based *Spatial Economics Toolbox for Fisheries* [(FishSET)](https://github.com/noaa-nwfsc/FishSET), a modeling and analytics package used to support NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center. Based at the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission in Portland, OR, I lead the ongoing development and maintenance of FishSET, which provides tools for data organization, spatial visualization, discrete choice modeling of fisher behavior, and simulation of policy scenarios to evaluate economic and welfare outcomes. In this role, I prioritize and implement new features, manage the GitHub repository, and serve as the primary technical point of contact for researchers and policy analysts. My work bridges data science, economics, and environmental policy to support evidence-based marine resource management.

Before my current role, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the [Palkovacs Lab](https://palkovacs.eeb.ucsc.edu/) at UC Santa Cruz's Institute of Marine Sciences, working in collaboration with NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center. My research focused on developing a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) framework for Chinook salmon in California's Central Valley, using population dynamics models to explore the biological and management implications of different harvest and conservation strategies. I earned my PhD in the [Humphries Lab](http://ahumphrieslab.com/) at the University of Rhode Island, where I built and analyzed population models to understand dynamics in coral reef fisheries - primarily focused on Indonesian fisheries. I also hold BS and MS degrees in biological sciences from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. My background integrates ecological modeling, statistical analysis, and quantitative programming to address complex questions in resource management, with a focus on balancing ecological sustainability and socio-economic outcomes.
