### About me

I joined the [Humphries Lab] (http://ahumphrieslab.com/) at the University of Rhode Island in 2016. Broadly, I'm interested in marine fisheries ecological and conservation research that can be used to inform management. For my dissertation, I'm investigating the impacts of fishing pressure, and the use of multiple fishing gears, on coral reef fish communities in Indonesia.
