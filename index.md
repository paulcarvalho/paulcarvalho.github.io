### About me

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Humphries Lab](http://ahumphrieslab.com/) at the University of Rhode Island (URI) developing multi-species fisheries models for deep-sea snapper and grouper fisheries in Indonesia. Broadly, I'm interested in marine fisheries ecology and conservation and interdisciplinary scientific research. Specifically, I aim to use population modeling to explore relevant fisheries managemnet questions and explicitly address tradeoffs between conservation and socio-economic objectives.

Prior to my current position, I received my BS (2014) and MS (2016) degrees at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo and my PhD in Biological and Environmental Sciences at URI (2020). I enjoyed my time in New England but I'm happy that my advisor allowed me to work remotely from California. Outside of my research, I enjoy many outdoor activities including surfing, diving, rock climbing, biking, fishing, and camping.
