### About me

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the [Palkovacs Lab](https://palkovacs.eeb.ucsc.edu/) at UC Santa Cruz's [Institute of Marine Sciences](https://ims.ucsc.edu/) and NOAA's [Southwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southwest-fisheries-science-center). For my postdoc research, I am developing a Management Strategy Evaluation for fall-run Chinook salmon in the Central Valley of California. I'm interested in fisheries ecology, fisheries management, and interdisciplinary science with the aim of exploring alternative management strategies to evaluate tradeoffs between conservation and socio-economic objectives. Prior to my current position, I earned my PhD at the University of Rhode Island in the [Humphries Lab](http://ahumphrieslab.com/) where I applied my interests to coral reef fisheries in Indonesia. Also, I earned my BS and MS in biological sciences at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. Outside of research, I enjoy many outdoor activities including surfing, diving, rock climbing, biking, fishing, and camping.
