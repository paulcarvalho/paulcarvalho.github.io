### About me

I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the [Palkovacs Lab](https://palkovacs.eeb.ucsc.edu/) at UC Santa Cruz's [Institute of Marine Sciences](https://ims.ucsc.edu/) and NOAA's [Southwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southwest-fisheries-science-center). For my postdoc research, I am developing a Management Strategy Evaluation for fall-run Chinook salmon in the Central Valley of California. I'm interested in fisheries ecology, fisheries management, and interdisciplinary science with the aim of exploring alternative management strategies to evaluate tradeoffs between conservation and socio-economic objectives. Prior to my current position, I earned my PhD at the University of Rhode Island in the [Humphries Lab](http://ahumphrieslab.com/).
fellow in the [Humphries Lab](http://ahumphrieslab.com/) at the University of R hode Island (URI) developing multi-species fisheries models for deep-sea snapper and grouper fisheries in Indonesia. Broadly, I'm interested in marine fisheries ecology and conservation and interdisciplinary scientific research. Specifically, I aim to use population modeling to explore relevant fisheries managemnet questions and explicitly address tradeoffs between conservation and socio-economic objectives.

Prior to my current position, I received my BS (2014) and MS (2016) degrees at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo and my PhD in Biological and Environmental Sciences at URI (2020). I enjoyed my time in New England but I'm happy that my advisor allowed me to work remotely from California. Outside of my research, I enjoy many outdoor activities including surfing, diving, rock climbing, biking, fishing, and camping.
