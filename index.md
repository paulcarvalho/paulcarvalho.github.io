### About me

I am currently a programming lead for the Fisheries Spatial Economics Toolbox [(FishSET)](https://github.com/noaa-nwfsc/FishSET) R package at the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission HQ in Portland, OR. and work in support of NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center. The FishSET package is a set of tools/functions for organizing and visualizing data, running discrete choice models to better understand fisher behavior, and simulating policy scenarios for exploring the welfare consequences of management decisions. As the programming lead, I guide the development of the R package, prioritize features to add and issues to address, maintain the package repository on GitHub, and serve as the primary contact for users. 

Prior to my current role, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the [Palkovacs Lab](https://palkovacs.eeb.ucsc.edu/) at the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Marine Sciences and NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center. For my postdoc research, I developed a Management Strategy Evaluation for fall-run Chinook salmon in the Central Valley of California. I earned my PhD at the University of Rhode Island in the [Humphries Lab](http://ahumphrieslab.com/) where I worked on fisheries population models for coral reef fisheries in Indonesia. I earned my BS and MS in biological sciences at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. In general, I'm interested in fisheries ecology, fisheries management, and interdisciplinary science with the aim of exploring alternative management strategies to evaluate tradeoffs between conservation and socio-economic objectives.
