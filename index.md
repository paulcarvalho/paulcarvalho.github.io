### About me

In 2016, I joined the [Humphries Lab](http://ahumphrieslab.com/) at the University of Rhode Island to pursue a PhD. For my dissertation research, I am investigating the impacts of fishing pressure, and the use of multiple fishing gears, on coral reef fish populations in Indonesia. Broadly, I'm interested in marine fisheries ecology and conservation and interdisciplinary scientific research. In addition to my PhD, I was a graduate research fellow at the [National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center](https://www.sesync.org/), where I worked with a group of graduate students to explore social discourse around environmental damage from hurricanes.

Prior to attending the University of Rhode Island (2 weeks prior!) I completed my MS degree at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo. I worked with Crow White at Cal Poly and developed bioeconomic fisheries population models to explore the convervation and socio-economic value of traditional management closures used in Melanesia. I completed my BS degree also at Cal Poly.
