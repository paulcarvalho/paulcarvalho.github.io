### Fisheries modeling

Fisheries models allow scientists to explore fish population dynamics in response to a variety of environmental (e.g. climate change) and anthropogenic (e.g. fishing) factors and help managers make informed decision. I use fisheries modeling techniques to explore the conservation and socio-economic tradeoffs of alternative fisheries management strategies.


### Fisheries independent indicators

Most coral reef fisheries lack the data required for traditional stock assessment methods.

### Socio-environmental synthesis

Social-ecological systems are complex networks
