### Management Strategy Evaluation

Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is a simulation method that models fish population dynamics and the full management process (data collection, stock assessment, harvest control rule, and management implementation). MSE are useful for exploring the tradeoffs of alternative management strategies, considering multiple stakeholders with diverse (and sometimes competing) objectives, and quantifying uncertainty in the outcomes from these strategies. I am using the MSE approach to evaluate the tradeoffs between hatcery practices, fisheries, water management, agricultural production, and the maintenance of robust and resilient Central Valley fall Chinook populations. We are currently in the early stages of this research, but hope to have updates soon!

### Fisheries modeling

Population modeling can be a powerful tool for assessing fish populations and exploring population dynamics in response to a variety of environmental (e.g. climate change) and anthropogenic (e.g. fishing) factors that otherwise would be difficult, or impossible, to explore through observational studies. I use fisheries models to investigate the impacts of various management strategies on fish biomass, fisheries catch, and catch efficiency (or catch-per-unit-effort). 

Using spatially-explicit fisheries models, I (along with an amazing team of scientists) tested the ability of periodically-harvested closures (PHCs) for meeting conservation and socioeconomic objectives. PHCs are centuries-old forms of fisheries management that are used widely throughout the Indo-Pacific. Interestingly, PHCs are often used to exploit the change in fish behavior during closed periods, which we were able to capture in our fisheries models. Exploiting this change in behavior resulted in PHCs outperforming non-spatial management and managemnet with no-take marine protected areas. Except for areas with really high levels of overfishing, where the conservation benefits of no-take marines protected areas can out weigh the catch efficiency and yield benefits of PHCs.

### Fisheries-independent indicators

Most coral reef fisheries lack the data required for traditional stock assessment methods. However, fisheries-independent indicators can be a cost-effective method to assess the population status of fishes on coral reefs.
